Clonal analysis:

+ Switched the meaning of the "inter" and "intra" labels in 
  `calculateInterVsIntra` function. Now, "inter" is the label used to form 
  distances that mean between clones, and "intra" is the label used to form 
  distances that mean on the inside, within each clone.

+ Changed the `plotInterVsIntra` output from a density plot to a histogram.

+ Changed the way to calculate the effective threshold. Now, desntiy approach is 
  used.
