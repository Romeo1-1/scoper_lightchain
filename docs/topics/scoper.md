**scoper** - *The SCOPer package*

Description
--------------------

Provides a computational framework for B cell clones identification
from adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-Seq) datasets. 
Three models are included (identical, hierarchical, and spectral) 
which perform clustering among sequences of B cell receptors 
(BCRs, also referred to as Immunoglobulins, (Igs)) that 
share the same V gene, J gene and junction length.
