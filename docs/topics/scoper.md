**scoper** - *The SCOPer package*

Description
--------------------

Provides a computational framework for unsupervised identification B cell
clones from adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-Seq) datasets.
This method is based on spectral clustering of the junction sequences of B cell
receptors (BCRs, Immunoglobulins) that share the same V gene, J gene and
junction length.

+ [analyzeClones](analyzeClones.md):       Summary statistics and visualization of the
clonal clustering results.
